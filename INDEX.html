            <p>
                Hello! I'm Rohit Kumar Singh, a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at SRM University. I have a strong foundation in programming languages, with proficiency in Python, Java, C, and C++. My journey in the world of technology has fueled my curiosity and shaped my skills to an intermediate level in these languages.

Beyond the realm of code, I have a keen interest in marketing, where I explore the intersection of technology and business. This dynamic combination allows me to approach problem-solving with a holistic perspective. I believe in leveraging my technical skills to create innovative solutions that resonate with both users and the market.

Throughout my academic journey, I have not only honed my programming skills but also developed a mindset that embraces challenges and seeks continuous learning. My experiences at SRM University have equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science, laying the groundwork for my future endeavors.

I am excited about the endless possibilities that technology offers and am always eager to take on new challenges. If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile individual with a passion for technology and a flair for marketing, I'd love to connect and explore how we can create something remarkable together.<br>

                        <p>Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language used by multiple giant companies.It
has simple and easy-to-use syntax making it the perfect language for someone trying to learn
computer programming for the first time. It is a high-level programming language, and its core
design philosophy is all about code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express
concepts in a few lines of code.The database is owned by Scapha group of companies which
helps input data regarding flights and passengers travelling through the airlines. The database
lets you search as well as update data of the flights and passengers which is already pre-existing
in the database. One can also delete records from the database. The flight data management
system offers a graphical report in pie-chart format through matplotlib.In short, the database
allows users to add, show, search, delete and edit flight records and passenger records in the database.

                        <p>A C++ program for restaurant management would need to perform tasks such as taking orders
from customers, managing inventory, calculating bills, and keeping track of sales data. The
program would need to be able to input and output data, manage data structures, perform
calculations, and provide a user-friendly interface for customers and employees. Additionally,
the program would need to be able to handle exceptions, errors, and invalid input.
This shows us the menu of the Restaurant named CUP O LOVE which have different dishes in
its menu. We can choose any dish from the menu and then choose the quantity of the dish and
proceed. The program generates the Bill of your order and displays it in brief. The bill includes order

name, quantity, price per piece, Total price.<br>
